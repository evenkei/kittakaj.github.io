		I've read about other trans women experiencing multiple orgasms from vibration/penetration. Maybe like once or twice I think I've experienced non-ejaculatory orgasms, such that I could also have an ejaculatory orgasm soon after. One time was from grinding my perineum on the edge of the bathtub, it was pretty surprising.

		I stumble across the concept of muffing, I think an excerpt from the <i>Fucking Trans Women</i> Zine by Mira Bellweather. Muffing is penetration of the inguinal canals. I find some muffing videos and try it out for myself. It's okay, but I'm not able to experience a lot of sensation, and it feels like having pubic hair kind of gets in the way.

		I've experimented with butt plugs and other anal toys with vibrators and stuff. Occasionally I experience good orgasms, most of the time it just seems like a lot of work. However, I do notice what a huge difference being "in the moment" makes as far as how easy and pleasurable it is to take something up the ass. Maybe someday.

		I'd be stressed about poop with a partner though. One time I saw a really thorough guide about how to wash yourself out, and it just seemed so incredibly time consuming and difficult. In my experience, if I'm eating well and otherwise feeling pretty good and healthy, I can do maybe 6 inches of penetration cleanly. So like. Small toys and fingering. IDK are y'all really just doing super intense enemas? Or just magically not getting poop everywhere somehow?

		A lot of it comes down to simple cost-benefit I guess, I don't really need to worry about this stuff unless/until I've actually worked up to having sex good enough where it's worth it in some way. Pro strats are counterproductive to a beginner, maybe.

		It's always been hard for me to learn in front of people. That's why I took Latin (dead language) and avoided lab sciences in college.

		As far as junk stuff goes, there's a lot I don't really know about my own feelings and preferences. Personally, I'm not really For or Against my having a dick. I think dicks can be nice and girl dicks are really cute and hot (theoretically, I've never actually interacted with anyone else's dick). But I'm also not sure how I'd want to use it in partnered sex. I think it could be nice to penetrate someone, but probably mostly if the partner being penetrated is acting toppy? I think the performer Mandi Mitchell is really good at inhabiting a wide range of chemistry dynamics, she has videos where she's topping people in a way that feels really girly and lesbian, and it's inspirational.

		I could see having a vagina being nice. Not sure I have strong feelings about it though. It's one of those funny things though that can be hard to tell until you learn or experience other stuff. I never thought specifically that I needed boobs. But now that I have little boobs, I really really like them and would love a little more.

		I got one of the critical darling We-Vibe Tango bullet vibrators recently. It's really nice and occasionally I can get really into it. Even when it's not super sexy it kind of just feels nice, like a massage. It has the kind of rumbly touch that my body can kind of read as touch and motion. I mainly use it on the tip of my dick, but also kind of all over, perineum, nipples, side of dick, etc. I've just used it by itself, but I think the idea is you can stick it in toys and stuff.

		I haven't used the Hitachi Magic Wand yet, which many trans women swear by. It seems a bit overpowered to my needs and I hear it's kind of loud which I'd get self-conscious about. But probably eventually idk.

		Every once in a while, I get the idea that it would be neat to make some kind of porn. Like games or comics or something. In particular, I think my niche would be something that's sort of dressed up or contextualized in some way so that it feels kind of less scary to people who are inexperienced. I just kind of look back on my own experiences, being really sheltered and then trying to deal with sexual feelings that I didn't know what to do with. And my experience with getting into mainstream porn was that it kind of led my brain down a path of seemingly irreconcilable partitioning.

		There's this little interactive fiction game called <i>Dream of an Acacia Tree</i> by Michaela Joffe, in which you play as an acacia tree. There's one part where you're getting pollinated by an insect and the game takes on the form of a dating simulator. The description of getting pollinated I remember finding legitimately hot and it was goofy and fun as well. It could be fun to do something like this with like plants or inanimate objects and like describing their functions in a way that mirrors talking about human sex but has no direct correlations.
	</p>
	<p>
		One idea I've had for a sexy game is: you're just looking at sexy drawings or reading a sexy story, but you're in like a nice moody setting. E.g. a cozy apartment at dusk in the rain. Just some literal contextualization to kind of gently reinforce that you can exist in the world and be horny simultaneously.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another idea: you have a cute partner who goes away and you think about how hot they are and picture them naked and stuff. I was imagining this as you're like a bee person lying inside of like a flower looking up at the sky. The player presses different buttons to guide the visualization. Then the partner comes home and you're like, "Hey~ I was thinking about you" dot dot dot.
	</p>
	<p>
		Or: there are those cheesy flash games where you have to select the right options and then more of a porn clip plays, or you reveal some sort of image. I find that like "working" for stuff kind of hot, but it would be neat to kind of invert the power dynamic. So rather than the woman being presented as a sort of prize robot trapped within a puzzle box, there could be an element of self-awareness. Narratively, the hot person could be the architect of the puzzle, and they could be like domming you into playing a stupid ass game because they know you want them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've never really followed through on any of these ideas though. I feel very undereducated in terms of dating games, sex games, and IRL sex. So I'm not sure if I'd have the structural framework to base decisions off of, and I'm also just not thinking about sex that much. But maybe I will make sex games Subscribe to my Patreon.

		I used to be mostly attracted to tiny feminine people. Pretty usual, as this body type is reinforced in our society as attractive. I still find people with this shape attractive sometimes, but it's kind of mixed in with the desire for myself to be small and feminine (the old, "do you want be with someone or do you want to be them?").
	</p>
	<p>
		At different points in my life, I also remember being attracted to people who seemed wholesome and Christian.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lately I tend to feel kinda swoony around tall and/or muscular people who have some kind of interesting mix of masculine and feminine elements.
