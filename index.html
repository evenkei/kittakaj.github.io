		Hey darlings, my name is Joni "Even" Kittaka. I am a nonbinary trans woman artist best known as the co-creator of video games such as Anodyne and Even the Ocean. <i>New Private Window</i> is a website memoir concerning some of my experiences around gender, sex, faith, and transition. A few notes before we dive in:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some of the topics discussed include: childhood, gender, sex, faith, and transition. There are some photographs in Chapter 7 that could be considered NSFW. Please take care of yourself.</li>
		<li>If you know me personally, be careful here and tread lightly.</li>
		<li>Names have been changed.</li>
	</ul>	
	<p>
		IMPORTANT: Certain parts of this site are meant to be opened in a private or "incognito" browser window, as a meditative act. These are the links with a <a class="private">black background</a>. If you can't or don't want to do that, it's okay don't worry about it (shout out to those of you who are already reading this in a private window, you're sweet and good).
