		Alex was my first kiss, at age 20. We kissed outside at night after deciding to be a couple. It felt kind of funny and I didn't quite get it. Later, they taught me to hold more tension in my lips. We kissed a ton throughout our relationship, but mostly like... old couple kissing.

		New Years Eve party at a gay bar in Portland, Maine. I sloppy drunk made out with trans masc friend Lionel, at age 25. We were grindy dancing and Lionel felt me up and stuff. We'd been friends for years but weren't like super close. It was super sweet and hot.

		Spring 2018, A gay party during GDC (Game Developers Conference in San Francisco). A cute stranger and I are vibing on each others moves as we danced in a little group with her friend and some others. Later on, she runs into me alone and we started dancing up close. She's really aggressive and it's really hot. We make out a lot and grind and feel each other up. My fave is when she bites my neck. It's also awesome when she sharply blows hair off my ear so she can bite and lick it. In lower moments when the beat dies down, we come apart a little and sort of check in. I want her to feel like she can scoot if she needs a break. But we keep on coming back together when the music ramps up until we're both exhausted and ready to leave.
